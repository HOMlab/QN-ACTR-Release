Note:

This Model Setup Assistant was designed in around 2013 to primarily work with the old QN-ACTR version implemented in Micro Saint Sharp. It has been discontinued, so some functions, such as driving task environment setup, may not work with the current QN-ACTR version implemented in Java. 

To see some of the recent models such as driving related models, please refer to \QN-ACTR-Release\Models\Models in published papers
