<h1>Join Properties <img src="../../image/topology/edit/join_icon.jpg" width="33" height="52" align="middle"></h1>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join stations are complementary to fork stations. In classical   queueing network theory, a task arrives at a join station from the corresponding   Fork station. </p>
<p><img src="../../image/topology/edit/model1.png" alt="fork-join" width="265" height="161"></p>
<p>In JSIM, a Join station may have incoming links from stations   other than the corresponding Fork one. A Join station has no service time, as it   is only used to recombine the tasks a job had been previously split into and   then route the job to some other station(s). When a task arrives at a join   station, it waits until all its sibling tasks have arrived. At this time, the   original job is recomposed and routed to the next station. If a job arrives from   a station other than the corresponding Fork, i.e., a job that was not split, it   is simply routed to the next station. In this case the Join station operates as   a routing station. </p>

<p>In the routing section, for every class defined, you can decide   how the completed jobs are routed to the other devices connected to station for   which the routing strategy is defined. </p>

The next job would be sent to the top station again,   and so on.</p>

    <td class="hcp2"><p align="left">With this algorithm, you can define the routing probability for each outgoing   link.The sum of all probabilities must equal 1. If the values provided do not   satisfy the constraint, JSIM automatically normalizes the values before the   simulation starts. This strategy requires that you define the probability foreach   output link via the panel on the bottom right of the window.</p>
