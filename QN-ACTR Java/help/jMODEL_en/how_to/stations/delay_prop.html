<p>_____________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers that arrive at this station are delayed for the amount   of time that defines the station service time. They do not experience any   queueing, since a delay station is modelled as a station with an infinite number   of servers with identical service time. Because customers never have to wait for   service, response time at delay stations is equal to service time, <EM>Ri =   Si</EM>. Furthermore, the queue length corresponds in this case to the number of   jobs receiving service since there is no waiting: <EM>Qi </EM>=<EM> RiXi = SiX =   Ui</EM>. The utilization of the delay center represents the average number of   jobs receiving service. <BR>
Delay centers are used when it is necessary to force   some known average delay. A common application of delay centers is to model   transmission time of large amounts of data over a dedicated low speed   transmission line. </p>

</ul>
<p>Delay stations are infinite servers with identical service time, therefore they   only need the service time distribution. The infinite number of servers provides   for equal average response time for all jobs, as no job waits in queue for   service. <BR>
In this section, the load dependent or independent nature of the   service time is also specified for each class in server stations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For each class, you must specify whether the service time is Load Dependent or   Load Independent using this menu: <img src="../../image/topology/edit/load_dipen_ind.gif" alt="load" width="109" height="71" align="top"></p>

    <p><em>Load Indipendent</em>:  A load independent service indicates that, regardless of the number of jobs that   are in the station, the system will serve all jobs following a fixed policy   modelled by the chosen statistical distribution.

    <p><em>Load Dependent</em>: A load dependent service time indicates that the amount of time the server   spends with each customer depends upon the current number of customers in the   station. A set of intervals for the number fo jobs in the station is specified,   either by adding one range at a time via the <img src="../../image/topology/edit/add_range.png" alt="add" width="115" height="21"> button or by specifying the total number at once. Each range   must them be specified by its lower (From) and upper (To) extremes. Each such   range can be associated with different service times, as for the distribution,   the mean and the coefficient of variation, or a subset thereof. <BR>
    To set the   parameters of a Load Dependent service time, click the  <img src="../../image/topology/edit/edit.png" alt="edit" width="55" height="23"> to edit the Service Time Distribution. This panel appearbutton and then specify the parameters for each added range: </p>

</ul>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>For each customer number range you must specify the following   parameters:</p>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <p><EM>Distribution: </EM>you can choose among Pareto, Erlang, Exponential, Hyperexponential,   Poisson, Uniform, Constant, Gamma and Normal distribution. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><EM>Mean: </EM>the mean   value of each distribution is specified in the "Mean" form by double clicking on   it. Insert a number or an arithmetic expression that will be evaluated with JFEP   - Java Fast Expression Parser by Bertoli Marco. For a complete list of the   command supported by JFEP you can read the "Help" tab or see the official JFEP   web site at http://jfep.sourceforge.net/ </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><EM>C: </EM>The   coefficient of variation of each distribution (when C exist) can be specified by   double clicking on the "C" form. For example, in the previous picture two   policies are defined: <BR>
      From 1 to 4 jobs in the station, the server will   behave according to an Erlang distribution with mean = 1 and C = 0.5. For any   number of jobs greater or equal to 5 in the station, the system will behave   according to an Exponential distribution with mean = 1.</p>
