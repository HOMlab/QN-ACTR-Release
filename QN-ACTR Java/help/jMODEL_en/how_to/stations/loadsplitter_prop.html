<h1>Routing Station Properties<span class="hcp2"><img src="../../image/topology/edit/loadsplitter1.png" width="81" height="49" align="top"></span></h1>
<p>______________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A routing station is a dummy station, with service time equal 0, that is used to   create more complex and sophisticated routing strategies by sending jobs through   one or more such stations. For example, if we wanted two thirds of the incoming   traffic at station Z to be randomly routed to either station A or B and the   remaining third to go either to station C or D, depending on the shortest queue   at the two stations, we could implement the following. Add a routing station, Y,   among Z's output stations and define random routing for the three of them (A, B,   Y). Then connect Y to C and D and define Shortest queue routing to C and D.</p>

<p>In the routing section, for every class defined, you can decide   how the completed jobs are routed to the other devices connected to station for   which the routing strategy is defined. </p>

The next job would be sent to the top station again,   and so on.</p>

If the values provided do not   satisfy the constraint, JSIM automatically normalizes the values before the   simulation starts. This strategy requires that you define the probability foreach   output link via the panel on the bottom right of the window.</p>
