  <p>Open classes are characterized by an infinite stream of jobs   that can enter the system. Source stations are used to introduce jobs in the   model. Their service time is the interarrival time of each customer class and as   such, it is defined as a parameter of the class the job belongs to. The routing   strategy defines the first station a newly created job will visit. Only open   class jobs can be routed from source stations. </p>

  <p>After a double click on the station icon you can see the properties panel:</p>

  <p><em>Station Name</em>:  name of the source. </p>

  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the routing section, for every class defined, you can decide   how the completed jobs are routed to the other devices connected to station for   which the routing strategy is defined. </p>
