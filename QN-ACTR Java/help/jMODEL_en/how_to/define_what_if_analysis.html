<h1>Define What-If Analysis</h1>
<p>_______________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A What-If Analysis consists of a series of simulations in which one or more   parameters are varied over a specified range. This allows the observation of   system behavior under a spectrum of conditions, unlike the single JSIM<em>Graph</em>   simulation run where the system is observed under a specific set of   configuration parameters. <BR>
By default the what-if-analysis is not enabled. It   must be activated explicitly and its parameters defined. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="Stile5">Activating the What-If Analysis</span> <A id="1" name="1"></A></p>
<p>After completing the definition of the model and selecting the <strong>What-if analysis</strong> tab, check the "Enable what-if analysis" checkbox to   activate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><span class="Stile5">Selecting the What-If Analysis Parameter</span> <A id="2" name="2"></A></p>
  <p>After enabling the what-if analysis, it is possible to select   the parameter to control the series of simulation runs using the menu below: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><IMG height="123" src="Images/type_selection.gif" width="484" border="0" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When you select a what-if analysis parameter, the bottom section   of the window will change depending upon the parameter. In the right portion a   description is provided of the selected parameter and of the impact of its   variation. In the left portion the details of the parameter range (From and To   fields) and the number of executions (Steps) on the range are provided. </p>
  <p>The set of modifyable parameters depends upon the number and   type of classes in the model:   
  <UL>
    <LI>
      <p>In a single class model, you simply select the parameters you   want to change during simulation.   
      </p>
    <LI>
      <p>In a multiclass model, you select the parameter and specify   whether you want to apply the variation to all classes or just to one class. </p>
    </LI>
  </UL>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="Stile1">Number of Customers:</span> (only for models with closed classes)<A id="customers" name="customers"></A></p>
  <p>JSIM repeats the simulation changing the number of jobs in each   run, starting from the number inserted in the "From N" field, to the value   inserted in the "To N" field. The simulation is repeated "Steps (n. of exec.)"   number of times.   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><IMG height="297" src="Images/customers.gif" width="369" border="0"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the figure above a what-if analysis is planned on a single   class model. <BR>
    The initial value of the number of customers is not modifiable   from this window, as it is part of the <strong>Classes</strong> tab. The final value is   specified in the field "To N". In this case, with a final value of 20 and 6   Steps, simulations are run for 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 customers,   respectively. Only the customer number in the class selected in the "Class"   (Chiusa, in the picture) will be changed. The remaining classes will keep their   initial number of customers. The simulator makes sure that the sum of the   percentages of customers in various classes add up to 1, as shown in the   "Population mix" table on the bottom of the window. <BR>
    If the "all-classes"   option is selected, the overall population is increased while keeping the   relative proportion of jobs in the various classes constant. Because the number   of customers in each class can only be an integer number, only the population   vectors with integer components can be considered. Therefore, the actual number   of executions may be smaller than the one specified.   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="Stile1">Population Mix:</span> (only for models with two closed classes and   possibly open ones) <A id="population" name="population"></A></p>
  <p>The population mix describes the way the population is divided   between the two class, i.e., the percentage of customers in each class over the   total populatoin. Because of the complexity of the underlying modeling, this   type of analysis is possible only for models with two closed classes. Mixed   class models can be analyzed too, as long as there are two closed classes. Only   the closed classes will be considered.   
  <p align="center"><span class="hcp2"><img src="../image/wif/numb_customers.png" width="277" height="176"></span>
  <p align="center">
  <p align="left">In order to allow for a complete analysis of the   population mix, in this case the initial value of the percentage of customers in   one of the two classes, the one selected through the "Class" field, can be   modified. Its default value is the ratio of the class population to the total   population of closed customers, defined in the <strong>Class</strong> tab. Both the final   and the initial &beta; are numbers on the range [0-1].   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="Stile1">Arrival Rate:</span> (only if there are open classes)<A id="arrival" name="arrival"></A></p>
  <p>Arrival rate is the frequency at which jobs arrive at a station   during a period of time. <BR>
    Similarly to the number of customers, the arrival   rate can be changed for one specific open class or for all the open classes in   the model. If a single class is selected, the final arrival rate and the number   of steps must be specified. The initial arrival rate is specified in the Arrival   Rate section of the <strong>Classes</strong> tab and it is not modifiable here. <BR>
    If the   arrival rate is to be changed for all classes, the final value is expressed as a   percentage, which is applied to all classes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../image/wif/ex1.png" width="272" height="134"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The figure above shows the settings for a what-if analysis on   the arrival rate of all the open classes. The "To" field is seto to 150%, which   means that for each class the final arrival rate will be one and a half times   the initial value. 10 runs will be exectued with equally spaced (in percentage)   intermediate values. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="Stile1">Service time: </span>(for all types of classes)<A id="service" name="service"></A></p>
  <p>Service Time is the time required by a customer class at each   visit at a station. In this case, besides the final value and the number of runs   to be executed, the station and the customer class (or all the classes) whose   service time will be varied must be specified. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../image/wif/ex2_service_time.png" width="235" height="105"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The figure above shows the settings for a what-if analysis of   the service time of class Class1 at station Server1. The service time   distribution will not change. Only its average will be modified to span the   range defined by the intial value (specified in the <strong>Station Parameters</strong> tab) and the final value specified here in the "To" field. <BR>
    If the "All   classes" option is selected, the range of service time to explore is expressed   in percetange, starting from the initial value specified at model definition   (100%). The station where the service time change is applied must be specified.   
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span class="Stile1">Seed:</span> (for all types of classes)<A id="seed" name="seed"></A></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="../image/wif/sedd.png" width="235" height="18"></p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Unlike the previous cases, where the analysis is performed for a   range of values of one of the model parameters in order to investigate the   system behavior under a variety of conditions, a what-if analysis on the seed   aims at evaluating the sensitivity of the simulation engine to numerical   conditions, in particular to the initial value fed to the pseudo-random number   generator, i.e., the seed. <BR>
    The Simulation engine uses a pseudo-random number   generator to generate the sequence of values used in each execution. By changing   the seed, a different sequence of values is produced, thus leading to different   numerical results. The first value is the one defined in the <strong>Simulation   Parameters</strong> tab. In this panel, the number of executions is specified and the   simulation engine generates as many pseudo-random seeds to be used in the   executions.
