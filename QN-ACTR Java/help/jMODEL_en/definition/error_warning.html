<h1>Error and Warning Diagnostic Messages</h1>
<p>_____________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JSIM<em>graph</em> analyses  the network  before starting the effective execution of the simulation. If any errors or warnings are found, the following window with their description is shown. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Click on the error or warning message to open the panel when you can modify the bad properties or change the network. </p>
<p>In the following table you can see some common problems with their solution:</p>

    <td valign="top" class="hcp2"><p>This error occurs when the station (source or join) has not   outgoing, or forward, links to any other station in the model. Only Sink   stations do not have forward links. </p>    </td>

Having a Fork without a Join is   possible, although it may lead the system to saturate quickly, hence the Warning   message. Having a Join without a Fork is a mistake, hence the Error message. The   missing station must be added with the corresponding links, see section &quot;<a href="../how_to/define_network_topology.html">How to define a network topology</a>&quot; for details. </p>    </td>
