<h1>Distribution</h1>
<p>________________</p>
<p class="stile1">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open classes model transaction workloads where the number of   requests in the system fluctuates over time and transactions arrive at the  system as if generated by an infinite source. The arrival pattern is well  described by a probability distribution, in particular, the distribution  of the interarrival times of consecutive transactions, or <em>customers</em>. </p>
<p>A probability distribution f(x) is characterized by : </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mean (if exists): <img src="distribution/Mean.gif" width="321" height="74" align="middle"></p>
<p>Variance (if exists): <img src="distribution/variance.gif" width="268" height="104" align="middle"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c, Coefficient of Variation, only if mean and variance exist    and mean is not zero: <img src="distribution/CoeffVariation.gif" width="195" height="78" align="middle"></p>
<p>JSIM<em>wiz</em> allows you to use any of the following probability   distributions:</p>

  </blockquote>
</ul>
<p>The mean is equal to <em>k</em>, which is the parameter  you must specify.
  This distribution describes a constant flow of customers, arriving exactly  every <em>k</em> time units.</p>

<p>The Erlang distribution is a continuous distribution, with    2 parameters: the <em>shape r</em>, an integer value, and the <em>rate &#945;</em>, a real value. It is a special case of Gamma distribution    where the shape parameter is an integer. <br>
  &#915;(t) is called Eulero function and is defined by <img src="distribution/eulergamma.gif" width="206" height="84" align="middle"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When r is a real non null positive integer, as in the  case of the Erlang distribution, the Eulero function reduces  to &#915;(r)=(r-1)!</p>
<p>A random variable (r.v.) with Erlang distribution  of order <em>r</em> can be obtained as a sum of <em>r</em> exponentially  distributed random variables with mean 1/r&#945;.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="distribution/erlang2.gif" width="333" height="125" ></p>
<p align="left">When you change the values of &#945; and r, the system  will automatically adjust the mean = = r/<em>&#945;</em> and the variance &#963;^2 = r/<em>&#945;</em>^2. <br>
  A family of probability density functions that illustrate the impact of various (&#945;, r) pairs is   shown below.</p>

<p>This is a continuous probability distribution where &#955; 
 &gt; 0  is the distribution parameter, often called the <em>rate</em> parameter; the distribution is supported on the interval [0,&#8734;).</p>
<p>The exponential distribution is used to model Poisson  processes, which are processes describing state changes of a system that occur  with constant probability per time unit &#955.  In this case, the time interval between two consecutive changes is  described by an exponential random variable with parameter &#955.  Therefore, if the system is in state A at time <em>t = 0</em>, the integral   of <em>f(t)</em> from 0 to <em>T</em> over <em>t</em> represents the  probability that the system is in state B ay time <em>t = T</em>.</p>
<p>When you select this distribution, the parameter &#955 is   requires (real number) and the mean is computed as <img src="distribution/exponential2.png" width="33" height="20"> while the variance is <img src="distribution/expo_var.png" width="26" height="43" align="middle"></p>

<p align="left">This is a continuous probability  distribution. The parameters are the <em>shape</em> &alpha; and the <em>scale</em> &#955, both real numbers.</p>
<p align="left">When you choose the Gamma distribution, you can either   provide &#945; and &#955; or the distribution mean, equal to &#945;*&#955;   and the variance &#945;*&#955;^2.

<p>A hyperexponential distribution describes a random  variable similar to an exponential but with more variability since it   is the result of a weighted sum of two independent exponentially distributed  random variables, with paramters &#955;1 and &#955;2 respectively.  The weight is the probability P that the random variable behaves   like the exponential variable with parameter &#955;1 and 1-P that it behaves   like the exponential variable with parameter &#955;2.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><img src="distribution/hyperExp1.gif" width="281" height="199"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this distribution is used to model the customer  interarrival time at a station (or the service time at that station), with  probability P the next interval before an arrival (service time) is  distributed like the upper branch in the figure above and with probability  1-P it will be distributed like the lower branch in the figure.</p>
<p>A family of probability density funtions   is  illustrated in the picture below. Note that when &#955;1= &#955;2, the  hyperexponential reduces to a simple exponential.</p>

<p>The Normal distribution is also called Gaussian since  its probability density function is the Gaussian function. It is well  known for its bell-shaped density function. <br>
  The two parameters are  &#956;=location  (real number, it is the mean of the  distribution), and &#963; =scale (real number, it is the standard deviation of the distribution i.e. the square root of the variance).  The density is symmetrical around the mean and the variance.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard</strong> normal distribution    is the normal distribution with &#956;= 0 (mean equal 0) and   &#963; = 1 (variance equal 1). <br>
  A family of probability density functions   is illustrated in the picture below. The standard distribution is   depicted in green.</p>

<p align="left">This distribution usually describes  social and economical phenomena (typically, the distribution of wealth,  where a small portion of the people owns the larger part of the wealth).  It is charcaterized by the parameters k&gt;0, location (real) and  &#945;&gt;0 shape (real).</p>
<p align="left">When requested to input the distribution parameters,  if k and &#945; are provided, the system automatically derives the  mean m = <em>k*&#945;/(&#945; - 1)</em> for k&gt;1 and the variance c <img src="distribution/pareto_c.png" width="141" height="57" align="middle"></p>

<p>The Poisson distribution describes the number of events  occurring over a given time interval, when such events are independent of  the amount of time elapsed and they occur at a fix average rate.   It is a discrete probability distribution characterized by a single   parameter, &#955;, a positive real number, which is the average number of  events in a time unit and its variance. <br>
  Thus, the probability of having an arrival in a time interval (t, t+&#916;t)
is &#955;&#916;t + O(&#916;t)), while the probability of more than one  arrival in the same interval is O(&#916;t). <br>
For large time intervals, the distribution is near the mean value, thus
the number n or arrivals over the interval is given by n = &#955;*T,
where T is the length of the interval<br>
</p>
<p>A characteristic of the Poisson distribution is that the time intervals
  between two consecutive events is exponentially distributed with average
  &#916;.</p>
<p>The parameter &#955; is not only the <em>mean</em> number 
  of occurrences but also its variance.</p>

<p>The t-distribibution, or Student t-distribution, is a 
  continuous distribution characterizaed by the single parameter &#957;, a real
  positive number. It is used when the mean of a normally distributed population
  must be estimate using only a small sample size. It is the basis of the
  Student-t's test that is used ot evaluate the statistical significance of
  the difference between two sample means and for the differencce between
  two population means.
  It is a special case of the generalised hyperbolic distribution. <br>
  The mean is 0 for &#957; >1 and the variance is &#957;/(&#957 -2) for 
  &#957; > 2 (infinite otherwise). <br>
  A family of probability density functions  for a set of &#957; values are illustrated in the picture below.</p>

<p>The Uniform distribution is sometimes called rectangular
  due the shape of its density function. 
  It describes a random variable that can assume values over the range 
  (<em>min, max</em>), its characterizing parameters, with constant probability
  equal to 1/(<em>max - min</em>). The probability is 0 outside the range. <br>
  When you choose this distribution, you can either provide the pair
  (<em>min, max</em>) or the mean m = (<em>max + min</em>)/2 and variance 
c = (<em>max - min</em>)^2 / 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The probability density function is plotted in the figure below. </p>
