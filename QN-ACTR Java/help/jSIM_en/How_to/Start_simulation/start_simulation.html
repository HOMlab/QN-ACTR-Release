<p class="stile4">When a model is complete and the 

<a href="../Create_a_new_model/step_8_-_simulation.htm">Simulation Parameters</a>

have been defined, you can start the simulation clicking the <img src="Images/start2.png" alt="icon" width="21" height="21">  button or 
  
selecting &quot;Start Simulation&quot; from the Simulation menu</p>
<p align="center" class="stile4">  <img src="Images/start1.png" alt="menu" width="412" height="156"></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">If there are errors and/or potentially critical conditions,

error and/or warning messages will appear, see

<a href="../Create_a_new_model/step_8_-_simulation.htm">Errors 

 &amp; warnings</a>. In case of errors, the simulation may not start

and errors must be corrected. In case of warnings, you can still start

the simulation but the results may not be consistent.

</p>



<p class="stile4">

If another simulation was executed before the current one, JSIM will 

warn you that previous simulation results will be overwritten if you

continue. Click Yes if you do not care about previous results, click

No if you wish to save previous results first and then restart the

simulation.</p>

<p align="center" class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="stile4">After the simulation has started, the results window appears, with 

partial values. In particular, for each performance index and for 

each station the index has been selected, the current number of

analyzed samples, the current average value and the graph of the latter

are constantly updated.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile4">

An hourglass indicates that the computation 

of that index is not finished yet. A checkmark in a green bullet indicates

that the computation of that index has successfully terminated.

In this case, the minimum and maximum average are reported as well.

<br>

At the bottom of the result window are the simulation control buttons,

namely the pause button (double bar), the start button (right pointing

triangle), and the stop button (square). The status bar indicates the

percentage of simulation executed so far, both graphically and numerically.
