<p class="stile1">Define What-If Analysis</p>



<p class="stile2">_________________</p>



<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">The parameters of a what-if analysis are defined using the

<b>What-if-analysis</b> tab.

</p>



<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p class="stile4">A What-If Analysis consists of a series of simulations 

in which one or more parameters are varied over a specified range. This 

allows the observation of system behavior under a spectrum of conditions,

unlike the single JSIM simulation run where the system is observed under 

a specific set of configuration parameters.

<br>

By default the what-if-analysis is not enabled. It must be activated 

explicitly and its parameters defined.

<p class="stile4">After completing the definition of the model and selecting

the <b>What-if analysis</b> tab, check the  

&quot;Enable what-if analysis&quot; checkbox to activate it.</p>

<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">When you select a what-if analysis parameter, the bottom 

 section of the window will change depending upon the parameter. 

In the right portion a description is provided of the selected parameter and

of the impact of its variation. In the left portion the details of the

parameter range (From and To fields) and the number of executions 

(Steps) on the range are provided.

</p>



<p class="stile4">The set of modifyable parameters depends upon the number

and type of classes in the model:



<ul>

	

<li class="stile4">In a single class model, you simply select

the parameters you want to change during simulation.</li>

	

<li class="stile4">In a multiclass model, you select

the parameter and specify whether you want to apply the variation

to all classes or just to one class.</li>

</ul>



<p class="stile6">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile6">Number of Customers (only for models with closed 

 classes)<a name=customers id=customers></a></p>



<p class="stile4">JSIM repeats the simulation changing the number of jobs 

 in each run, starting from the number inserted in the &quot;From N&quot;

field, to the value inserted in the &quot;To N&quot; field. The simulation

is repeated &quot;Steps (n. of exec.)&quot; number of times.





<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p Align="center" class="hcp2"><img src="Images/customers.gif" style="width:369px; height:297px;" width="369" height="297" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">In the figure above a what-if analysis is planned on

a single class model.

<br>

The initial value of the number of customers is not modifiable from this

window, as it is part of the <b>Classes</b> tab.

The final value is specified in the field &quot;To N&quot;. In this case, 

with a final value of 20 and 6 Steps, simulations are run for 10, 12, 14,

16, 18 and 20 customers, respectively. Only the customer number in the

class selected in the &quot;Class&quot; (Chiusa, in the picture) will be

changed. The remaining classes will keep

their initial number of customers. The simulator makes sure that the 

sum of the percentages of customers in various classes add up to 1,

as shown in the &quot;Population mix&quot; table on the bottom of the window.

<br>

If the &quot;all-classes&quot; option is selected,

the overall population is increased while keeping the relative proportion

of jobs in the various classes constant. Because the number of customers in 

each class can only be an integer number, only the population vectors with

integer components can be considered. Therefore, the actual number of

executions may be smaller than the one specified.



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile6">Population Mix: (only for models with two closed

classes and possibly open ones) <a name=population id=population></a></p>



<p class="stile4">The population mix describes the way the population is

divided between the two class, i.e., the percentage of customers in each

class over the total populatoin. Because of the complexity of the 

underlying modeling, this type of analysis is possible only for models

with two closed classes. Mixed class models can be analyzed too, as long as 

there are two closed classes. Only the closed classes will be considered.
<p align="center" class="stile4"><img src="Images/popmix.png" alt="population mix" width="257" height="112">
<p align="center" class="stile4">

<p align="left" class="stile4">  In order to allow for a complete analysis of the population mix, in 
  
  this case the initial value of the percentage of customers in one of the
  
  two classes, the one selected through the &quot;Class&quot; field, can
  
  be modified. Its default value is the ratio of the class population to 
  
  the total population of closed customers, defined in the <b>Class</b> tab. Both the final and the initial &beta; are numbers on the range [0-1].
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile6">Arrival Rate: (only if there are open

classes)<a name=arrival id=arrival></a></p>

<p class="stile4">Arrival rate is the frequency at which jobs arrive 

at a station during a period of time.

<br>

Similarly to the number of customers, the arrival rate can be changed

for one specific open class or for all the open classes in the model.

If a single class is selected, the final arrival rate and the number of

steps must be specified. The initial arrival rate is specified in the 

Arrival Rate section of the <b>Classes</b> tab and it is not modifiable here.

<br>

If the arrival rate is to be changed for all classes, the final value

is expressed as a percentage, which is applied to all classes.

</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p Align="center" class="hcp2"><img src="Images/ex1.gif" style="width:272px; height:134px;" width="272" height="134" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">The figure above shows the settings for a what-if analysis 

on the arrival rate of all the open classes. The &quot;To&quot; field

is seto to 150%, which means that for each class the final arrival rate

will be one and a half times the initial value. 10 runs will be exectued 

with equally spaced (in percentage) intermediate values. 

</p>

	

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile6">Service time (for all types of

classes)<a name=service id=service></a></p>



<p class="stile4">Service Time is the time required by a customer class at

each visit at a station. In this case, besides the final value and the

number of runs to be executed, the station and the customer class (or

all the classes) whose service time will be varied must be specified.

</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p Align="center" class="hcp2"><img src="Images/ex2_service_time.gif" style="width:235px; height:105px;" width="235" height="105" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">The figure above shows the settings for a what-if 

analysis of the service time of class Class1 at station Server1. 

The service time distribution will not change. Only its average will be 

modified to span the range defined by the intial value (specified in 

the <b>Station Parameters</b> tab) and the final value specified here in

the &quot;To&quot; field. 

<br>

If the &quot;All classes&quot; option is selected, the range of service

time to explore is expressed in percetange, starting from the initial

value specified at model definition (100%). The station where the 

service time change is applied must be specified.



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile6">Seed (for all types of classes)<a name=seed id=seed></a></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile4" style="text-align: center;" Align="center"><img src="Images/sedd.gif" style="width:235px; height:18px;" width="235" height="18" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>
<p class="stile4" style="text-align: center;" Align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="stile4">Unlike the previous cases, where the analysis is performed

for a range of values of one of the model parameters in order to investigate

the system behavior under a variety of conditions, a what-if analysis on the

seed aims at evaluating the sensitivity of the simulation engine to numerical

conditions, in particular to the initial value fed to the pseudo-random

number generator, i.e., the seed.

<br>

The Simulation engine uses a pseudo-random number generator to generate

the sequence of values used in each execution. By changing the seed, a different

sequence of values is produced, thus leading to different numerical results.

The first value is the one defined in the <b>Simulation Parameters</b> tab.

In this panel, the number of executions is specified and the simulation

engine generates as many pseudo-random seeds to be used in the executions.
