<p class="stile1">Define stations </p>



<p class="stile2">_________________</p>



<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">When you create a new model, you must define the Stations 

 from the <b>Stations</b> page of the tabs menu. </p>



<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4" style="text-align: center;" Align="center"><img src="Images/define_station1.gif" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" style="width:454px; height:376px;" width="454" height="376" border="0" class="hcp1"></p>



<p class="stile4" style="text-align: Center;" Align="center">&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">You can insert one station at a time, by pressing 

the <img src="Images/button_addStation.gif" name="immagini2" style="width:117px; height:20px;" width="117" height="20" border="0" Align="bottom" class="hcp2"> button,

or multiple stations all at once, by choosing the desired number in the 

input form <img src="Images/button_Nstations.gif" name="immagini3" style="width:117px; height:25px;" width="117" height="25" border="0" Align="bottom" class="hcp2">.

The added stations will be listed in the page.

Various types of stations are available, the default type being <em>server</em>.

<br>

If you want to remove any of the stations, select the target and press the

corresponding <img src="Images/delete.gif" style="width:16px; height:17px;" width="16" height="17" border="0" class="hcp3"> delete button.

<br>

Stations are name Station1, Station2, and so on by default. If you want 

to assign model-relevant names, left-clik on a name to change and replace 

it.

Similarly, if the default station type Server is not what you need, 

select from the drop down menu of each station the correct type.

<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">Customers that arrive at this station are delayed for

the amount of time that defines the station service time. They do not 

experience any queueing, since a delay station is modelled as a station

with an infinite number of servers with identical service time.

Because customers never have to wait for service, response time at delay

stations is equal to service time, <em>Ri = Si</em>.

Furthermore, the queue length corresponds in this case to the number of

jobs receiving service since there is no waiting:

<em>Qi </em>=<em> RiXi = SiX = Ui</em>. The utilization of the delay center

represents the average number of jobs receiving service.

<br>

Delay centers are used when it is necessary to force some known

average delay. A common application of delay centers is to model 

transmission time of large amounts of data over a dedicated low speed

transmission line. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">The Queueing station is one of the most important components

in a queuing network model. Queueing stations represent the service facilities

of the system being modelled. A queueing station provides the required service to 

its customers. Queueing stations may have any (finite) number of servers.

If all the servers in the service station are busy when a customer arrives 

at the station, the arriving customer is put in a waiting queue until its

turn to receive service from the first available server is up.

The queueing discipline decides which customer is served next when a queueing station

becomes free.

Therefore, the response time at server stations includes service time and

queuing time.

<br>

Queueing stations may have more than one server. Their number is a 

parameter to be specified (default is 1).</p>

<p class="stile3">3 - Fork station: <img src="Images/fork.gif" style="width:26px; height:25px;" width="26" height="25" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">

A JSIM Fork station is simply a station where jobs are split into tasks.

No service is provided, therefore there is no service time specification.

Tasks are then routed along the Fork station outgoing links.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile4">

Unlike classical queueing theory fork-join queues, a JSIM Fork station

is not associated with a join station automatically. 

Any combination of server stations, finite regions, fork-join, routing

stations, etc., is possibile after a Fork station.

This feature allows the modeling of very general parallel behaviors, of

which the traditional Fork-Join one is a special case.

In JSIM the classical queueing theory Fork-Join queue behavior is obtained

by connecting the Fork station to as many Server stations as the degree of

parallelism requested, with one task per outgoing link. 

Each Server station is then connected to a Join station, where the job is

recomposed.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stile4">

A Fork station is characterized by the forking degree, i.e., the number of

tasks routed on each one of its outgoing links, and the capacity,

i.e., the maximum number of jobs that can be served by the station

simultaneously.

Therefore, the number of sibling tasks a job is split into is given by the product of 

the number of outgoing links from the Fork station times the forking degree.

Note that a finite station capacity makes sense only when there is a join

station downstream from the fork station that can recompose the split jobs.

Otherwise, inconsistencies in the model and subsequent simulation error,

such as out-of-memory, may occur. No automatic checks are available at

the moment that can identify such critical conditions.

Both the forking degree and the capacity are section parameters to be

specified in the model.

As an example,

a Fork station with forking degree 1, connected to three Server stations,

would split a job into 3 sibling tasks (this is a traditional Fork-Join like behavior).

If no Join station is connected to any of the three Servers, a warning

message is displayed since the model could quickly saturate due to the

extra load (3 more jobs) created in addition to each job entering the Fork

station.

<p class="stile4">In the Station Parameters page of the tabs menu,

you can modify:

<br>

<p class="stile4"><em class="stile6" style="font-style: italic;">Fork Section:</em>

in this section you can choose the forking degree of a job on each outgoing

link and the fork station capacity, i.e., the maximum number

of jobs that can be served in parallel by the station.

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4"><em class="stile6" style="font-style: italic;">Queue Section: </em>

in this section you can choose the type of queue (finite or infinite) of the 

fork station in case its capacity is finite and jobs must wait before 

proceeding through the fork station.

<p class="stile3">4 - Join station: <img src="Images/join.gif" style="width:25px; height:25px;" width="25" height="25" border="0" class="hcp3"></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">Join stations are complementary to fork stations.

In classical queueing network theory, a task arrives at a join station

from the corresponding Fork station. 

In JSIM, a Join station may have incoming links from stations other than

the corresponding Fork one.

A Join station has no service time, as it is only used to recombine 

the tasks a job had been previously split into and then route the job

to some other station(s). 

When a task arrives at a join station, it waits until all its sibling tasks

have arrived. At this time, the original job is

recomposed and routed to the next station.

If a job arrives from a station other than the corresponding Fork, i.e.,

a job that was not split, it is simply routed to the next station. In this case

the Join station operates as a routing station.

<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">A routing station is a dummy station, with service time

equal 0, that is used to create more complex and sophisticated routing

strategies by sending jobs through one or more such stations.

For example, if we wanted two thirds of the incoming traffic at

station Z to be randomly routed to either station A or B 

and the remaining third to go either to station C or D, depending on the

shortest queue at the two stations, we could implement the following.

Add a routing station, Y, among Z's output stations and define

random routing for the three of them (A, B, Y). Then connect Y to C and D

and define Shortest queue routing to C and D.

<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile4">If the model comprises at least an open class, a sink and 

 a source stations are created by default, as they are necessary for the

simulation and cannot be removed</p>

<p class="stile4">Open classes are characterized by an infinite stream of jobs 

that can enter the system. Source stations are used to introduce jobs 

in the model. Their service time is the interarrival time of each customer

class and as such, it is defined as a parameter of the 

class the job belongs to. The routing strategy defines the first station 

a newly created job will visit. Only open class jobs can be routed from

source stations.

<p class="stile4">Open class customers leave the system once they have

Sink stations are used to model customers leaving the system, as they

Sink stations have no parameters, only incoming connections from one or more

stations, depending upon the model.</p>
