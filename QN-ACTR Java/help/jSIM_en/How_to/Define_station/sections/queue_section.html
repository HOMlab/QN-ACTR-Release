a station can accept any customer and let them wait in quue, in which case its 
capacity is considered infinite, or it can only accept a finite number 
of customers. In this case its capactiy is finite, with a length to be 
specified in the form <img src="../Images/lenght.gif" style="width: 105px;

it is the algorithm used to decide which customer to serve next. 
A variety of factors can contribute to the order in which customers 
are served, such as arrival order, priorities associated with a class,
the amount of service already provided to customers, etc.
<br>
In JSIM queueing disciplines based on arrival order and priority are the 
only available, namely:

<ul>
<li class="kadov-p" class="kadov-p"><span class="hcp1"><B>FCFS:</B></span>
under the First Come First Served queueing discipline, customers are served 
in the order in which they arrive at the station. If the model is exported
to MVA, the following constraint is enforced in the exported model.
Since all customer classes must have the same average service time at
a FCFS station, the total number of visits to the station (Vc,k) is adjusted
in order to comply with the constraint and at the same time allow for 
distinct service demands (Dc,k).</li>
	
<li class="kadov-p" class="kadov-p"><span class="hcp1"><B>FCFS (Priority):</B></span>
under this policy, customers are ordered according to their arrival time
but customers with higher priority jump ahead of customers with lower 
priority (conventionally a <em>small</em> priority number = low 
 priority). Customers with the same priority are served FCFS.</li>
	
<li class="kadov-p" class="kadov-p"><span class="hcp1"><B>LCFS:</B></span>
under the Last Come First Served queueing discipline, an arriving job jumps 
ahead of the queue and will be served first, unless other jobs arrive before
the one currently in service finishes.
The LCFS discipline implemented in JSIM is not the preemptive-resume 
type. 
</li>
	
<li class="kadov-p" class="kadov-p"><span class="hcp1"><B>LCFS (Priority):</B></span> 
under this policy, the next customer to be served is one with the highest 
priority (conventionally a <em>small</em> priority number = low priority),
so an arriving customer can only jump ahead of the queue of the other jobs
with the equal or smaller priority.
Customers with the same priority are served LCFS.</li>
