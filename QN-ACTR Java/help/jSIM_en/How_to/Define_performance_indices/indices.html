<p class="stile1">Performance Indices:</p>



<p class="stile2">_________________</p>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">Queue Length:<a name=1></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Number of customers at a center, both waiting and receiving 

 service.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">Queue Time:<a name=2></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Average time spent by the customers waiting in a station

queue. It does not include the Service Time.</p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">Residence Time:<a name=3></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Total time spent at a station by a customer, both queueing 

and receiving service, considering all the visits at the station. </p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">Response Time <a name=4></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Average time spent in a station by a customer for a single request

(it is the sum of Queueing time and Service time).</p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">System Response Time:<a name=4b></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Average time a customer spends in the system in order

to receive service from the various stations it visits. 

It corresponds to the intuitive notion of response time, as the interval

between the submission of a request and the reception of the response.</p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">Utilization:<a name=5></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Percentage of time a resource is used 

w.r.t. the system lifetime; it varies from 0 (0%), when the station is

always idle, to a maximum of 1 (100%), when the station is constantly busy

serving customers for the entire system lifetime.</p>
<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="stile4">If a queueing station has more than one server, utilization is the average utilization of all servers. </p>
<p class="stile4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="stile4">In delay stations, for consistency with Little's law, the utilization is computed as the average number of customers in the station. So, its value may be grater than 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">Throughput:<a name=6></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Rate at which customers departs from a station, 

i.e., the number of services completed in a time unit.</p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">System Throughput:<a name=7></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Rate at which customers departs from the system.</p>

</blockquote>



<p class="stile3">&nbsp;</p>



<p class="stile3">Customer Number:<a name=8></a></p>



<blockquote>

<p class="stile4">Average number of customers in the system.

If the index is associated with a closed class, then it is 

 equal to the number of customers in the class.</p>
