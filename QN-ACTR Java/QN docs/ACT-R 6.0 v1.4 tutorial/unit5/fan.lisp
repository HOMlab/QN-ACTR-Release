#| The solution commented out here works with the
   alternate test-sentence-model that does not use the
   visual interface for input or the motor module for
   a response and produces the same results at the 
   cost of estimating the parameters for the efforts 
   of the productions for encoding and responding.

   The benefits are a simpler model and a faster running
   time (approximately half the time to run the above
   version with a virtual interface).
