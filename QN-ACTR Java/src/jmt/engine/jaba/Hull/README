HULL
----

Hull reads a file containing a list of 3D points, constructs their
convex hull, and writes it to an output file using the OFF file
format.  OFF files can be viewed using Geomview
http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/download/geomview.html

The algorithm used to construct the convex hull is an implementation
of the point insertion algortithm given in Joseph O'Rourke's
``Computational Geometry in C''.


usage: Hull <infile> <outfile>


The input file format is as follows:

x[0] y[0] z[0]
...
x[n] y[n] z[n]

The (x, y, z) must be integers in the range -512...512.

The OFF file format is described in the Geomview documentation.

Hull has been developed using jdk-1.1.5

Revision History
----------------

-- v1.2 --

2 Dec 1998	Replaced integers with longs in Triangle.volumeSign()

-- v1.1 --

17 Mar 1998	Replaced use of Polygon.volume6() with more efficient
		Polygon.volumeSign().  This also allowed 
		ConvexHull.COORD_RANGE to be increased from 512 to 1000000

-- v1.0 --
