Analytical solver for queueing network models.<br>
This package contains different solution techniques which
should be used according to the model type.<br>
In fact, models can be distinguished in many ways.<br>
First of all, as regards the number of classes, we can distinguish:

<ul>
    <ui>single class models, i.e. models with only one class of
customers</ui><br>
    <ui>multiclass models, i.e. models with different classes of
customers</ui><br>
</ul>

Customer classes can be open or closed.<br>
For these reasons, models can be:

<ul>
    <ui>single class open models</ui><br>
    <ui>single class closed models</ui><br>
    <ui>multiclass open models</ui><br>
    <ui>multiclass closed models</ui><br>
    <ui>multiclass mixed models</ui><br>
</ul>

Furthermore service centers can be load independent (LI) or load
dependent (LD).<br>
So each of the models seen above may be LI or LD.<br>
The package contains solution techniques for almost all of these cases.<br>
In particular, for closed models, uses the well-known Mean Value
Analysis(MVA) algorithm.
