In this demo, the display shown in screenshot 1.png is represented.

The model will try to find a button showing 5000 units for the dose, and then click it. 

In trace.txt file, between different runs of the simulation, the model will randomly search the visual area. 
Sometimes it will find the 5000 unit button at the first try, but sometimes it will try mulitple times looking at different buttond. 

When the 5000 unit button is clicked, the java console will display "5000units_clicked".

Search this line of source code in the ServerLogics.java will lead to the code area for System.out.println("5000units_clicked");
